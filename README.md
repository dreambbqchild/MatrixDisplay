# MatrixDisplay
Play games n' stuff on an LED Matrix

This'll drive a rgb matrix hat from Adafruit in a vertical configuration. With the wires I had available, I ended up stacking the panels in reverse order and the middle one is upside down. The software is built to account for that.

There's also an console renderer that exists to help with debugging. This also includes an implemention of Snake with blinking eyes and a flicking tongue. :)
